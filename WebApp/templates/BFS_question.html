    <h4>CoronaVirus</h4>
    <p>Recently, a new virus broke out in k cities in a country at time t=0. Country can be viewed as a (n x m) grid((0, 0) at the top left and (n-1, m-1) at the bottom right). In every second, the virus spreads from the infected cities to its neighbours that is the cells directly connected to it(up, right, bottom,left). Let time[i][j] denote the time at which the city i,j got the infection. Find the value of (&sum;((i + 1) x (j + 1) x time[i][j])) modulo 1e9 + 7</p>
    <h4>Constraints</h4>
    <p>1&le;n,m&le;1000</p>
    <p>1&le;k;&le;n x m</p>
    <h4>Input</h4>
    <p>First Line contains n, m, k the number of rows, columns in the grid and the number cities which got infected at t=0. The next k lines contains 2 integers i,j denoting the cell infected</p>
    <h4>Output</h4>
    <p>Print an integer denoting the hash value</p>
